# Olve.MsdfAtlasGen

A .NET wrapper for Viktor Chlumský's [msdf-atlas-gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen)
tool. This package includes pre-built native binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## About

This is **not** an official package - it's a community-maintained wrapper to make
msdf-atlas-gen easily usable from C#/.NET projects.

All credit for the atlas generation goes to Viktor Chlumský and the msdf-atlas-gen project.
